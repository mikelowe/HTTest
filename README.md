HTTest
=====

We need to randomly generate a load of publication metadata and related fulltext for testing.

Each publication generated should have its own directory (named after the publication identifier), and contain two xml files: publication.xml & fulltext.xml

* output
	* publication-1
		* publication.xml
		* fulltext.xml
	* publication-2
		* publication.xml
		* fulltext.xml
	* publication-3
		* publication.xml
		* fulltext.xml
	* etc...

The structure of each xml file is provided in the associated files here.
